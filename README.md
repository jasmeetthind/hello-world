Hello Everyone!!

My name is Jasmeet and I am a big fan of Harry Potter. I loved reading both the books and watching the movies. I also love reading fanfiction. Wathcing anime is also a favourite pass time of mine. My all time favourite anime is Naruto. I am hoping to start watching Attack on Titan and One Piece soon. Other than that, I enjoy playing sports such as volleyball and ultimate frisbee. Ice skating is also a hobby of mine.
